# Git Test

## Overview

A series of test questions on using Git in the command line.

## Description

I created this test as I quickly realized that there were many concepts in Git that I was unfamiliar with. So, I read through the documentation found here: https://git-scm.com/docs and created multiple choice questions to strengthen my understanding about Git. Because collaborating with other developers is such a fundamental skill in the tech industry today, it was incredibly beneficial for me to take the time to reinforce my understanding. 

I previously created a multiple choice test that used only front-end technologies, which meant that the questions were stored only in a front-end script file. This time, I decided to store the questions in a MySQL database to make the front-end script file more concise and so that correct answers aren't visible in the front-end source code. This was a great opportunity for me to refresh my skills in building full-stack applications with Node, MySQL, Handlebars, and Express. It was also a lot of fun for me to create a typing animation to make the UI more interesting.
